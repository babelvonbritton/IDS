# What is located in this directory?

This directory contains some OpenBSD extensions that I developed several years ago but found useful.

- [pf_norm.c.patch.txt](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/blob/master/patches/pf_norm.c.patch.txt): extends the `pf` normalize with the capability to clear the IPv4 reserved bit, if set (written in 2011).
